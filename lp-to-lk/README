Launchpad to Leankit
====================

This script is a fairly simple tool, you just give it your LeanKit Kanban credentials, a bug number in Launchpad and the lane you want to add the card in and it creates a card with the following details:

Type: Defect
Title: The title of the bug in Launchpad
Description: The description of the bug in Launchpad
Card ID: The Launchpad bug number
External Link: The Launchpad bug link

Caveat: The lane has to have a name that is unique within the board.
Caveat 2: The tool only works for the Canonical MAAS team board! This is an obvious improvement that could be made.
